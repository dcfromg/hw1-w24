        <h2>Monteverde, Costa Rica</h2>
        <h3>Geographical Location: South America</h3>
        <p>
          Monteverde, Costa Rica is situated 4,662 feet above sea level.
          Monteverde’s famed cloud forests are the byproduct of fog (a thick,
          low-hanging cloud) tangling amongst the leaves and branches of the
          forest canopy. Trails and hanging bridges offer a close-up view of the
          diverse variety of animals and plants living in the forest.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the main tourist locations in Monteverde is the town of Santa
          Elena, which is not only home to a variety of restaurants with

          ziplining, and observing the native wildlife while staying in
          Monteverde. It’s a truly beautiful place.
